ðŸ“Œ Project Summary: Titanic Survival Prediction

This beginner-level machine learning project focuses on predicting passenger survival from the Titanic disaster using Logistic Regression. The dataset includes demographic and travel-related features such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and embarkation point.

Key steps included:

    Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (one-hot encoding), and feature selection.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized survival patterns by gender, class, and age group to extract insights.

    Model training: Implemented logistic regression using Scikit-learn to predict survival outcomes.

    Model evaluation: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to assess performance.

    Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Google Colab.

This project demonstrates foundational skills in data science, binary classification, and model interpretation.
